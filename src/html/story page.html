        <p class="fear">Pardon me, but would ya mind if I fired me cannon through your porthole? Come show me how ye bury yer treasure, lad! There comes a time in most men’s lives where they feel the need to raise the Black Flag. “I’ve got a jar of dirt! I’ve got a jar of dirt, and guess what’s inside it?” “Why is the rum always gone?” Ahoy! lets trouble the water!
        </p>
        <p class="fear"> The rougher the seas, the smoother we sail. Ahoy! you know, thats the 2nd time I’v watched that man sail away with my ship. Merchant and pirate were for a long period one and the same person. Even today mercantile morality is really nothing but a refinement of piratical morality.
        </p>
        <p class="fear">So, tell me, why do they call ye, “Cap’n Feathersword?” Damnation seize my soul if I give you quarters, or take any from you. How much does the pirate pay for an ear piercing? … A buccaneer! (buck- in- ear…) Right from the Voyage og Noah, surviving was by sailing. Avast ye! and sail against the tides.

          You’re drinking a Salty Dog? How’d you like to try the real thing? Me I’m Dishonest. And A Dishonest Man You Can Always Trust To Be Dishonest. Honestly Its The Honest Ones You Want To Watch Out For Because You Never Know When They Are Going To Do Something Completely Stupid! Life’s pretty good, and why wouldn’t it be? I’m a pirate, after all.
